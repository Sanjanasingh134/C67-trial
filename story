There was a crocodile who lived with his wife in the river.
The crocodile and the monkey became good friends. 
The monkey used to drop berries from the tree which the crocodile loved to eat.
One day he took some brries for his wife. 
She ate it and said " the monkey's heart would be very sweet as he eats these berries daily.
She asked the crocodile to get the monkey's heart for her.

His wife then made a plan and asked him to call the monkey for lunch at their house.
